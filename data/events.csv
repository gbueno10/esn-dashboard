Hey there travelers, 🧳✈️<br>
If you are interested in traveling, you can’t miss this chance to meet Guimarães while enjoying your Erasmus to create new friendships. 🫂</p>
<p><br>
Guimarães was the first portuguese capital and it’s known as the “cradle of Portugal” 🇵🇹. It’s a cozzy city, full of history that you will be delighted to explore. Portuguese culture and ancient roots were born here, so it’s a good city to understand this country better while having fun with ESN. 💙</p>
<p><br>
Classified as World Heritage 🌍 by UNESCO since 2001, the historical center is a mandatory visit for anyone who wants to know Portugal and you will have the opportunity to do so, together with that we’ll also visit two very important monuments, the castle (Castelo de Guimarães) and the palace, Paço dos Duques 🏰. To finish everything we’ll take you to watch the sunset in a beautiful place called Serra da Penha! 🌆</p>

</p>
<p>Let's have fun and explore Serralves, an 18-hectare park well known for its biodiversity and its varied environments (lakes, ponds, forests, gardens, …). 🍃 Beyond its natural beauty, Serralves is home to lots of art, be it in the museum or spread out throughout the park, and, of course, to a huge shovel stuck on the ground at one of the entrances.<br>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, you’ll get to visit all of the important bits in a guided tour. The tour will show you the museum with its multiple exhibitions, from traditional to more abstract ones 🎨. You’ll also get to freely explore the park and visit the Treetop Walk, a wooden path built around the trees that lets you see the park from a new perspective (try not to look down if you get queasy with heights!). 🌳<br>

<p>Hey there travelers,</p>
<p>If you are interested in traveling, you can’t miss this chance to meet Guimarães while enjoying your Erasmus to create new friendships. 😎</p>
<p>Guimarães was the first portuguese capital and it’s known as the “cradle of Portugal”. It’s a cozzy city, full of history that you will be delighted to explore 🕵️. Portuguese culture and ancient roots were born here, so it’s a good city to understand this country better while having fun with ESN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classified as World Heritage by UNESCO since 2001, the historical center is a mandatory visit for anyone who wants to know Portugal and you will have the opportunity to do so, together with that we’ll also visit two very important monuments, the castle (Castelo de Guimarães) and the palace, Paço dos Duques. To finish everything we’ll take you to watch the sunset in a beautiful place called Serra da Penha!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still haven't convinced you to come?</p>
<p>8h30 - Meeting Point @Trindade</p>
<p>10h00 - Arrival to Guimarães</p>
<p>10h15 - Visit to Castelo de Guimarães and Paço dos Duques</p>
<p>12h30 - Free time for Lunch</p>

<p>17h00 - Visit to Serra da Penha</p>
<p>19h00 - Departure from Guimarães</p>
<p>20h00 - Arrival in Porto</p>
<p><u><em>But what should you know about what we'll be seeing?</em></u>🤔</p>
<p><strong>Guimarães Castle</strong> - this castle is older than Portugal itself! It was built in the 10th century to defend the kingdom against the invasion of the Muslims. The castle was greatly strengthened in the 13th century, which is what you see today.</p>
<p><strong>Paço dos Duques</strong> - Built by the eighth Count of Barcelos, the Paço dos Duques is a majestic mansion. It was built between the years 1420 and 1433. Today it’s a museum where the decorative pieces are designed to create the illusion that visitors are entering an inhabited house.</p>
<p><strong>Serra da Penha</strong> - In the historic center you can see a hill of more than 600 meters. It consists of more than 60 hectares of green area. Here you can enjoy a wonderful panoramic view that stretches to the ocean.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>What is included:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>All you need to bring is your energy, love, and some comfy clothes to join us in an animal shelter where you can be a volunteer for a day. You will spend a lovely day outdoors, make new friends, and leave a little yet impactful mark on the world by helping your community 🫂. Be sure your clothes match the activity so choose comfortable instead of fashionable (but we know our Erasmus are always fashionable even when they don’t try) 🧵.</p>
<p>The change starts with you so don’t miss the opportunity to make a change and to give your unconditional love to a new furry friend 🐕. With this you can redefine your Erasmus experience by doing something rewarding and, who knows, find a new passion.</p>

<p>That’s right, we proudly present to you&nbsp;“Let’s Talk About Health”, an&nbsp;event where specialists will hold speeches about interesting topics in their respective areas, in a format close to that of a TedTalk (but better).</p>
<p>To give you the right amount of healthy energy we'll have a Zumba Class before anything else, and two coffee breaks during the day. To smooth the mood we'll need to groove, and for that we'll have two amazing artists playing and singing for us!</p>
<p>Finally, if you'd like to learn and discuss health along with your fav ESNers and experts in Mental Health, Sports and Nutrition, in a fun and chill environment, join us and Let’s Talk About Health!</p>

Do you love to travel? Do you like partying and students’ academic traditions? If so, this trip is going to be all you have been waiting for this semester, and more! ✨</p>
<p>If you’ve done your “Portugal Starter Pack” research, at this point you know that Coimbra is one of the most important cities in Portugal. Coimbra is full of history in every corner and mixes the traditions and its magnificent old architecture with the youngness of being “the city of students”. 👩🏼‍🎓 👨🏼‍🎓</p>
<p>We will start in a place where everybody will feel like a giant: Portugal dos Pequenitos! It is one very picturesque place, as everything is dwarfed in size, in the most famous miniature park in Portugal! Are you ready to discover the world from a different perspective?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, while at the student city, we can’t miss visiting the University of Coimbra - the oldest in Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe - that inspired the costumes of Harry Potter and all the other students in Hogwarts…I know, a pretty epic scenario!</p>
<p>About Paço das Escolas, we are talking about UNESCO World Heritage. It was the Royal Square since D. Afonso Henriques Kingdom, first king of Portugal in 1140 (oof that’s a lot of years ago). The Biblioteca Joanina is located at Paço das Escolas and it is a Baroque style Library, known as one of the biggest and most original European Baroque libraries!&nbsp;</p>

<br>
As this is a spooky month we want to show you a very spooky traditional party, full of superstition and mysticism!<br>
<br>
We are talking about “Noite das Bruxas” (Witch night) that happens every Friday the 13th in Montalegre. It is based on the myths, tales and legends of the popular culture of the region.<br>
It’s said that the Witches leave the Misarela Bridge to terrorize the region...<br>
<br>
You’ll have the opportunity to feel the mystic traditions in the streets, the decorations, theatre performances, concerts and the fireworks. This is the time to let go of all of your sins… Or perhaps commit some more.<br>
<br>
Usually, it gets a little cold in Montalegre… But you’ll get warm with the typical drink “Queimada” which will ward off the evil eye. However, if it’s extremely hot, it’s because of you.<br>
Who knows which spells you’ll be under this night… Join us to find out!</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>🚨 <strong>Warning: This trip includes a total of 8km trekking (4km to Drave + 4km back) and it is considered to be of moderate difficulty.</strong><br>
</p>
<p>It’s time to hit the road to <strong>Drave</strong>… but what is Drave?!</p>
<p>If you don’t know, there’s nothing to be ashamed of! Many good old Portuguese fellows are also not fully familiar with it but we’re here to enlighten you!<br>
</p>
<p>This hidden gem is located in the <strong>Arouca Geopark</strong> and it is an old abandoned village in the middle of mountains and maintained by scouts, composed of schist houses, which are typical villages all throughout Portugal! If the breathtaking views don’t already impress you, these houses will rock!<br>
</p>
<p>But if you think this national treasure was easily reached you couldn’t be more wrong… there’s a reason why it is called a hidden gem and it is because it’s not connected to highways (the fact that you can’t drive to Drave…) and it takes a 4km trekking from the nearest village to get there!<br>
</p>
<p>Good thing is… our path will be filled with <strong>waterfalls, natural pools, where you will be able to swim and rest for a while.</strong><br>
</p>
<p>If you’re up to a challenge and an outside-of-the-box pick to impress your instagram followers… this one's for you!<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the timeframe for this trip:</strong></p>
<p>8h30: Meeting Point @Trindade</p>
<p>10h30: Arrival to Regoufe</p>
<p>10h30-10h30: Arrival to Drave</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Porto!</p>
<p>Are you excited for this new adventure? We couldn’t be more happy to have you here!<br>
</p>
<p>With that in mind, we planned an incredible Integration Picnic, to help you warm up to our city!<br>
</p>
<p>This will be an amazing opportunity for you to start knowing your future Erasmus friends and your fantastic ESNers! But this is not a mere picnic… we are preparing a lot of activities for you!<br>
</p>
<p>On this day we’ll have games, music, dance, and even a yoga class for you to relax with the ocean breeze! Oh, and Portuguese snacks!<br>
</p>
<p>Don’t miss this opportunity to integrate into the Erasmus Community, to have fun, and of course, to get to know our biggest park, Parque da Cidade.</p>
<p>Moreover, the park is right next to the Matosinhos beach, so, if you want to, you can go see one of the prettiest sunsets of the city after you leave.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to bring comfy clothes for the activities, a towel to sit down on, and your reusable cup for the drinks!</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Feel free to bring your own snacks and be prepared to take food with you when the picnic ends since there will most likely be some leftovers (you get some food and you help us reduce the amount of waste, it’s a win-win!).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>: Integration Picnic</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>: Sunday, 16th of September, 15:30 (NEW DATE)</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Parque da Cidade (The specific location within the park will later be shared!)</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>t’s time to hit the road to <strong>Drave</strong>… but what is Drave?!</p>
<p>If you don’t know, there’s nothing to be ashamed of! Many good old Portuguese fellows are also not fully familiar with it but we’re here to enlighten you!</p>
<p>This hidden gem is located in the <strong>Arouca Geopark</strong> and it is an old abandoned village composed of schist houses (not to be confused with 💩) which are typical villages all throughout Portugal! If the breathtaking views don’t already impress you these houses will rock!</p>
<p>But if you think this national treasure was easily reached you couldn’t be more wrong… there’s a reason why it is called a hidden gem and it is because it’s not connected to highways (the fact that you can’t drive to drave…) and it takes a <strong>4km trekking </strong>from the nearest village to get there!</p>
<p>Good thing is… our path will be filled with <strong>waterfalls, natural pools</strong> and a killing energy sponsored by your ESNers and fellow Erasmus!</p>
<p>If you’re up to a challenge and an outside-of-the-box pick to impress your instagram followers… this one's for you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's have fun and explore Serralves, an 18-hectare park well known for its biodiversity and its varied environments (lakes, ponds, forests, gardens, …). Beyond its natural beauty, Serralves is home to lots of art, be it in the museum or spread out throughout the park, such as a huge shovel stuck on the ground at one of the entrances.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you’ll get to visit all of the important bits in a guided tour. The tour will show you the museum with its multiple exhibitions, from traditional to more abstract ones. Some current exhibitions that you may see include art by Carla Filipe, Manoel de Oliveira, Rui Chafes and maybe even a smidge of Miró. Walk through the Treetop, a wooden path built around the trees that lets you see the park from a new perspective (try not to look down if you get queasy with heights!), and, obviously, the park is proper.</p>

<p>You must be really confused at this point, ""Doesn’t ESN know how to spell?"", but there is a reason behind the title of the event. Some might already know why this night is different from other editions. &nbsp;But to the newbies, here's your answer: because we <strong>CARE</strong>. We care about someone, and we care about a cause so we called it “<em><strong>Care</strong></em><strong>oke Night</strong>”.</p>
<p>We only ask a little favor of you guys. If you can, bring some <strong>school supplies to support Panela100Tampa</strong>, a non-profit organization that fights for basic human rights and seeks to combat social exclusion by empowering families, children and young people and that just furnished the construction of a school in a village in Guinea-Bissau.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Besides having an amazing evening and singing our hearts out, we can also help others in need. Get ready to have the time of your life, sing, dance, and possibly uncover hidden stars.</p>

<p>As it is a versatile destination, on this trip you will have the opportunity to visit a palace that seems to be taken from a princess movie, lose yourself in the beauty of the most enchanting and mysterious gardens, lose your breath with some of the most beautiful views in Portugal, set foot on the westernmost point of Continental Europe and, last but not least, have an adventure in our beloved capital.</p>
<p>The advice we can give you is to prepare yourself to live in a real-life fairy tale and to prepare your jaw to be amazed more often than usual, as this trip includes a visit to one of the seven wonders of Portugal (Palácio da Pena), to a property classified as world heritage by UNESCO (Quinta da Regaleira), while you will have also one of the best moments of your exchange, accompanied by out best friends and your favorite ESNers. :)</p>
<p>You don't want to miss this opportunity, so make sure you secure your spot!</p>

<p>If you are a music lover, you play an instrument, spend hours in the shower because of the acoustic, or can’t pass by without your spotify playlist, then, good news: Let’s Jam together!</p>
<p>A Jam Session is a specific event where everyone is invited to step into the stage to play or sing, either improvising with others or performing something previously prepared.</p>
<p>If you are more of a watcher, it’s also fine, you can just enjoy it while others play, it is up to you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>First to the Jam, there is a concert that opens it, but after it, it’s free time for you to get up the stage and explore your own rhythm.</p>
<p>At this bar, you will be able to experience the real Porto nightlife among locals and musicians that gather there every Thursday to share some music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you ready to Rock some Roll? Or to jazz it good? Maybe we should Pop it up!&nbsp;</p>

640f8ee3a96d523263880608,[FULL] Trip to Coimbra,2023-03-25 08:00:00.000,,"<p>Hey there, travelers! Are you up to the next trip?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Do you love to travel? Do you like partying and students’ academic traditions? If so, this trip is going to be all you have been waiting for this semester, and more!<br>
</p>
<p>If you’ve done your “Portugal Starter Pack” research, at this point you know that Coimbra is one of the most important cities in Portugal. Coimbra is full of history in every corner and mixes the traditions and its magnificent old architecture with the youngness of being “the city of students”.<br>
</p>
<p>We will start from the very beginning: when Coimbra was a roman city! We will start with Ruínas de Conimbriga, one of the oldest, biggest and most important archeology traces in Portugal. It used to be a city during the Roman Empire. Let’s dig into some ruins and resurrect B.C. memories.<br>
</p>
<p>Well, we’re still gonna visit a library and the University of Coimbra - the oldest in Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe - that inspired the costumes of Harry Potter and all the other students in Hogwarts…I know, a pretty epic scenario!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>About Paço das Escolas, we are talking about UNESCO World Heritage. It was the Royal Square since D. Afonso Henriques Kingdom, first king of Portugal in 1140 (oof that’s a lot of years ago). The Biblioteca Joanina is located at Paço das Escolas and it is a Baroque style Library, known as one of the biggest and most original European Baroque libraries!<br>
</p>
<p>Do you want to have an amazing Erasmus experience and absorb as much as possible of our University culture? Check the program below!<br>

<p>WARNING! We advise you to prepare yourselves because you’re in for a ride! Only the toughest ones will survive until the end. The real question is…will you be one of them?</p>
<p>And how will it work? We will all gather in front of Museu da Fotografia (map here) at <strong>9:00 pm sharp</strong>. We always start with our favorite game: Sangria Line! But with a special twist 👀 <strong>Pleaseee, don't be late (or you'll miss the beginning of the games!)</strong></p>
<p>You will be divided into teams and then you will have a map telling you where the pubs are. (The map is usually an ESNer…) Along with the pubs, your team will get a special list of CHALLENGES to accomplish during the event!</p>

<p>Hey there travelers,</p>
<p>If you like to travel and get adventurous in the company of new amazing friends, then you won’t miss the chance to visit the historical and emblematic city of <strong>Guimarães</strong>.</p>
<p>Guimarães was the first Portuguese capital and it’s considered the birthplace of the country. It’s a cozy city, full of history and where a big part of our culture was born, which makes it a good city to understand the roots of the Portuguese people while having fun with ESN.</p>
<p>Classified as <strong>World Heritage by UNESCO</strong> since 2001, the historical center is a mandatory visit for anyone who wants to know Portugal and you will have the opportunity to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, we’ll also visit two very important monuments: The castle (Castelo de Guimarães) and the Palace (Paço dos Duques) so you get a glimpse of the old capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To finish everything we’ll take you to watch the sunset in a beautiful place called Serra da Penha!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still haven't convinced you to come?</p>

<p>Hello Portugal’s newest explorer, 🇵🇹</p>
<p>This time we bring you a proposal for a trip back in time: <strong>we are going to the oldest Portuguese city!</strong></p>
<p>Also known as the Rome of Portugal, you will have the opportunity to visit the city that abounds in flower gardens and churches, in addition to being recognized for its typical pastries - we are talking about Frigideiras, Tíbias and, also, Pudim Abade de Priscos.</p>
<p>In 2012 it was elected the European Youth Capital and this city is the reason why the days of the week in Portuguese are counted differently from Spanish or English.</p>
<p>During this trip, you will see the beautiful Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte. It is located on the top of a mountain with an incredible view of the city. Make sure you bring comfortable sneakers because you’ll have 581 steps to climb. No joke. But trust us, it’s worth it!</p>
<p>With all these hints, could you figure out which city we are talking about?</p>
<p><strong>BRAGA</strong>, ofc!</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Porto!</p>
<p>Are you excited for this new adventure? We couldn’t be more excited to have you here!</p>
<p>With that in mind, we planned an incredible <strong>Integration Picnic</strong>, to help you warm up to our city!</p>
<p>This will be an amazing opportunity for you to start knowing your future Erasmus friends and the unbelievable team that organizes the ESN events.</p>
<p>Beyond eating and talking, you’ll have access to multiple activities, like a yoga class, a zumba class, and some orienteering to get to know the park better!</p>
<p>Don’t miss this opportunity to integrate the Erasmus Community, to have fun, and of course, to eat. The picnic will happen in our biggest park, <em>Parque da Cidade</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the park is right next to the Matosinhos beach, so, if you want to, you can go see the sunset there after you leave.</p>
<p>Feel free to bring your own snacks and towels, and be prepared to take food with you when the picnic ends since there will most likely be some leftovers (you get some food AND helping us reduce the amount of waste, it’s a win-win!).</p>

<p>Hello hello party animals!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You better gather all your drinking buddies because we got great news for you……*drum roll*</p>

<p>Aka one of our most wanted and anticipated events! There’s no better way to start the semester than to get to know all the best bars in Porto in one night only right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we advise you…prepare those livers of yours because you’re in for a ride! Only the greatest ones will survive until the end. The real question is…will you be one of them?</p>
<p>And how will it work? We will all gather in front of Museu da Fotografia (<a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/vXSnXd9ncMdcRjvb7"" target=""_blank"">map here</a>) at 9:00pm sharp. We always start with our favorite game: Sangria Line! But with a special twist&nbsp;👀</p>
<p>Pleaseee, don't be late (or you'll miss the beginning of the games!)</p>
<p>You will be divided into teams and then you will have a map telling you where the pubs are. (The map is usually an ESNer…) Along with the pubs, your team will get a special list of CHALLENGES to accomplish during all the event!</p>
<p>So come warm yourselves and (literally) forget about the cold and run to secure your spot!</p>

<p>Hello travel lovers!</p>
<p>Do you want to visit a city full of traditional boats, enchanting and colorful buildings and eat traditional sweets? Then you are in for a treat!</p>
<p><strong>Aveiro</strong> is <strong>Portuguese’s Venic</strong>e and on this amazing trip you will be able to enjoy the beautiful views and discover the city on board of traditional boats called “<strong>Moliceiros</strong>”, taking you for stunning trips on the canal running through the town.&nbsp; All the enchanting buildings of the art nouveau style will catch your eye and invite you to stop and wander inside for a peek at Aveiro’s history.</p>
<p>In this romantic city there’s also a traditional sweet called “Ovos-Moles” and on this trip you will be able to not just eat them but to actually learn how to make them! This local delicacy translates literally to “soft eggs from Aveiro” and it’s made from egg yolks and sugar. The filling is soft due to the freshness of the ingredients. Surrounding it is a pastry made from wheat flour, which will give the sweets the typical shapes of clams, barrels, fish, and more.</p>
<p>And to finish, we will end this awesome trip at a fisherman’s village called “Costa Nova'' known for its beautiful striped houses and spend some time beside the beach side.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to experience Portuguese’s Venice with us?</p>

<p>Beloved students! Unfortunately, we bring you the last event of the semester, and we could only finish it in style, with one more trip to remember. It is time to celebrate the great times we had together and have one last unforgettable trip. We want to make it big this time, so we are going a bit further with our trips and going abroad to the World Heritage city of <strong>Salamanca in Spain</strong>.

<p>So what is Nochevieja? Nochevieja was born spontaneously&nbsp;in 1999 when a group of university students decided to gather in <strong>Salamanca's Plaza Mayor to celebrate a kind of New Year's Eve before everyone from their group went home!</strong> That turned out in a&nbsp;tradition that grew bigger every year, and nowadays the last Nochevieja edition has joined&nbsp;35000&nbsp;people. Students gather in Plaza Mayor and eat 12 gums after the bells signal midnight, and then proceed to go out to party all night.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>You must be really confused at this point, ""Doesn’t ESN know how to spell?"", but there is a reason behind the title of the event. Some might already know why this night is different from other editions.&nbsp; But to the newbies, here's your answer: because we CARE. We care about someone, and we care about a cause so we called it “Careoke Night”.</p>
<p>Once again we ask a little favor of you guys. If you can bring some <strong>perishable food or feminine hygiene products</strong> to support <em><strong>Lar de Nossa Senhora do Livramento</strong></em><strong>, a non-profit organization that fights against child neglect and domestic violence, caring for girls from ages 6 to 25</strong>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Besides having an amazing evening and singing our hearts out, we can also help others in need. Get ready to have the time of your life, sing, dance, and possibly uncover hidden stars.</p>

<p>Let's have fun and explore <strong>Serralves</strong>, an 18 hectare park well known for its biodiversity and its varied environments (lakes, ponds, forests, gardens, …). Beyond its natural beauty, Serralves is home to lots of art, be it in the museum or spread out throughout the park, such as a huge shovel stuck on the ground on one of the entrances.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you’ll get to visit all of the important bits in a guided tour. The tour will show you the museum with its multiple exhibitions, from traditional to more abstract ones. For example, some main highlights like Paula Rego, Augustina Bessa-Luís and Cindy Sherman. Walk through the Treetop, a wooden path built around the trees that lets you see the park from a new perspective (try not to look down if you get queasy with heights!), and, obviously, the park proper.</p>
<p>In the end a Picnic is awaiting in the immense garden, where you can calmly take in the sights with us and your friends! Feel free to bring some additional snacks if you want to!</p>

<p>We know that we have MANY “<strong>Harry Potter</strong>” fans among us! But the Muggles are invited to join as well! Ready to <em>obliviate </em>without using any spell and embark in a crazy ESN adventure? Bring your railway ticket because we will take you on <strong>ESN Porto Express to Braga</strong> at platform 9¾ at São Bento Station! For the non-harry potter fans, what we’re trying to say is: <strong>TRAIN PARTY</strong>! 🎉</p>
<p>So this is how it’s gonna go: we will gather more than 200 erasmus students (and a bunch of ESN members, because you will need someone to protect you from the dark magic), put them all in a train and we will only stop in <strong>BRAGA</strong>! Braga is our oldest city, covered with secrets and many places to discover!</p>
<p>You probably already know that we take pride in having a bit of history with Harry Potter here, so there is no way we wouldn’t make this Train Party a bit magical... We’ll have some magic potions onboard but don’t forget to bring one or two drinks (<strong>but only in plastic bottles! </strong><u><strong>Glass or aluminum bottles are not allowed on the train</strong></u>) and your reusable cup!</p>
<p>And since all this is inspired in our loved Harry Potter, we will also form groups that will represent the different houses of Hogwarts: <strong>Gryffindor</strong> 🦁, <strong>Ravenclaw</strong> 🦅, <strong>Hufflepuff</strong> 🦡 and <strong>Slytherin</strong> 🐍! The houses will compete in some drinking games during the <strong>Botellon</strong>! And then… <strong>PARTY TIME</strong> in a muggle’s place, called club! 🪩</p>
<p>After all this amazing and magic night, partying in another city, yes, we will come back to the best city of Portugal, our PORTO!</p>

<p>The <strong>SID</strong> are meant to raise social awareness and every ESN section from all over the world is doing special activities and events at the same time!<br>
</p>
<p>During this activity we planned to play <strong>Goalball</strong> which is a <strong>collective sport meant for people who are visually impaired</strong>. The objective of the game is to put the ball on the adversary’s goal by using your hand. For this you will need to use a blindfold so you can play according to the rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to spot the ball by the sound of the bells inside of it so, during this game, you will need to concentrate and use the sense of touch and hearing.</p>
<p>We would like to have you with us this evening to try a different sport while having tons of fun and never forgetting the important message behind it: it is crucial to fight for inclusion for all in sports and life!</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>After the working hours, our Office becomes lonely and dark…just kidding! This is when the fun starts! Would you dare to join us <strong>Office After Hours - Social Impact days</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>ESN</strong> is celebrating the <strong>Social Impact Days</strong> all over the world between the <strong>7th and 20th of November</strong>, which means we want to get closer to our community, to give you a floor to share your thoughts and closely impact each other’s lives. ESN believes the whole society can have benefits from mobility programs. In this sense, the “Social Impact Days'' is a project related to ESN’s mission: the enrichment of society through international students.</p>
<p>During this activity we aim to debate some topics related to mobility and how to keep our own balance during this life changing experience. When we find ourselves in a new city, who can help us during the tough times? Is it possible to build a family during mobility? How can I improve other people’s lives?</p>
<p>Do you want to make a difference and know how to make a positive Social Impact? Come and join us during a cosy and chill afternoon.</p>
<p>Besides, you can also count on some delicious snacks and great surprises along with your favorite ESNers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get outrageous and join us when the door closes.<br>

<p>If you already feel overwhelmed by all the events that have happened since your arrival in Porto and if you feel like you need some time to stop and relax, then the Mental Pottery Workshop is for you!</p>

<p>So, join us in this afternoon where you will have the possibility to occupy your mind with pottery and clay modeling, while freeing your mind from any worries, in addition to participate in a workshop on one of the fundamental and inseparable aspects of health - mental health.</p>
<p>Can we count on you to get your hands dirty (literally 😜)?</p>

<p>Hello brave travelers!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in cities with history, then this trip will be a perfect fit for you! This time we are going to take you to the Portuguese Rome: Braga! Also known as “Bracara Augusta”, the oldest existing city in Portugal!<br>

</p>
<p>You will get to see one of the most known attractions in Portugal - the beautiful Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte. It is located on the top of a mountain with an incredible view over the city, that will allow you to&nbsp; update your Instragam pictures! Make sure you bring comfortable sneakers, cause you’ll have 581 steps to climb. No joke.<br>

<p>Hey there travelers,</p>
<p>If you are interested in traveling, you can’t miss this chance to meet Guimarães while enjoying your Erasmus to create new friendships. 😎</p>
<p>Guimarães was the first portuguese capital and it’s known as the “cradle of Portugal”. It’s a cozzy city, full of history that you will be delighted to explore. 🕵️‍♂️ Portuguese culture and ancient roots were born here, so it’s a good city to understand this country better while having fun with ESN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classified as World Heritage by UNESCO since 2001, the historical center is a mandatory visit for anyone who wants to know Portugal and you will have the opportunity to do so, together with that we’ll also visit two very important monuments, the castle (Castelo de Guimarães) and the palace, Paço dos Duques. To finish everything we’ll take you to watch the sunset in a beautiful place called Serra da Penha!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still haven't convinced you to come?<br>

You can teach them some Turkish or German, or simply let the kids have a taste of your culture.</p>

They are those little places around you that probably you didn't even notice! And since you probably never actually got to try them out, we want to give you the best Tascas experience!</p>

<p>Are you brave enough to conquer the capital of Portugal?</p>
<p>In this 3 day adventure you’ll see Lisbon’s amazing sights, monuments and original street art. You can get ready for delicious food and have fun all day (and all night).</p>
<p>You’ll have the opportunity to visit some of the most iconic monuments and get lost in the city’s picturesque narrow streets during the day! After that… PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG!!! During these days we are going to visit some places that will take your breath away. We are going to teach you by day and to destroy all of your brain cells by night!!</p>
<p>For example, Terreiro do Paço, which is one of the most majestic squares in Lisbon. It was once a palace, but got almost completely destroyed after the 1755 earthquake. Castelo de São Jorge is an emblematic landmark where you will have an amazing view of the city.</p>
<p>We couldn’t leave without passing by Belém Tower, a World Heritage site, and probably the most important monument in Lisbon. It’s a 16th century fortress where you can climb the spiral staircase up to the terrace, where you’ll find a breathtaking panorama of the river. And of course, you couldn’t go home without trying the traditional PASTEL DE BELÉM!</p>
<p>We know you love Porto, but you don’t want to miss the opportunity of spending 3 days with your favorite people showing what real party animals look like.</p>
<p>Lisbon is known as the city of the Seven Hills, but, for you, it’ll be the city of the Seven Deadly Sins. And trust us, what happens in Lisbon, stays in Lisbon.</p>

<p>Hello travelers,</p>
<p>Are you brave enough to conquer the capital of Portugal?</p>
<p>In this 3 day adventure you’ll see Lisbon’s amazing sights, monuments and original street art. You can get ready for delicious food and have fun all day (and all night).</p>
<p>You’ll have the opportunity to visit some of the most iconic monuments and get lost in the city’s picturesque narrow streets during the day! After that… PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG!!! During these days we are going to visit some places that will take your breath away. We are going to teach you by day and to destroy all of your brain cells by night!!</p>
<p>For example, Terreiro do Paço, which is one of the most majestic squares in Lisbon. It was once a palace, but got almost completely destroyed after the 1755 earthquake. Castelo de São Jorge is an emblematic landmark where you will have an amazing view of the city.</p>
<p>We couldn’t leave without passing by Belém Tower, a World Heritage site, and probably the most important monument in Lisbon. It’s a 16th century fortress where you can climb the spiral staircase up to the terrace, where you’ll find a breathtaking panorama of the river. And of course, you couldn’t go home without trying the traditional PASTEL DE BELÉM!</p>
<p>We know you love Porto, but you don’t want to miss the opportunity of spending 3 days with your favorite people showing what real party animals look like.</p>
<p>Lisbon is known as the city of the Seven Hills, but, for you, it’ll be the city of the Seven Deadly Sins. And trust us, what happens in Lisbon, stays in Lisbon.</p>

<p>We want to turn our favorite place into your second home too because, at this point, we’re all family. So we created this event, where you can share your experiences, opinions, existential crisis… Basically, everything. Porto is incredible, but it’s even more amazing if you have someone to talk to.</p>
<p>You are now one month into “the best time of your life”, and we know there is more going on besides all the smiles on your selfies. Perhaps you miss your mum’s food or your pet. Maybe you discovered your ""true self"" or even your other half. It might be that you have managed to cross many things off your bucket list. Or maybe none of these happened and you feel disappointed...</p>
<p>Well, we have good news! Whatever is going on, Office After Hours encourages you to share, in a place where you can hear and be heard, meet new people, strengthen the relationships you already have, have a laugh or just give a hug to someone that really needs it. And, not least important, your new favorite Portuguese (ESNers) will be there too! All experiences are welcome and you’re free to share as much as you want. Join us!</p>

<p>Hello beautiful people!</p>
<p>Have you been in the city for a few weeks and need to *finally* learn some of Porto’s culture? Like tasting Porto Wine and seeing our beautiful city from its beautiful River? No worries! ESN Porto got you covered with the Boat Trip and Wine Cellars activity!</p>
<p>First, we will start with a nice and relaxing boat trip in the Douro river, where you will be able to see the beautiful Unesco World Heritage Sites that you have on both sides of the river.

Thus, ESN Porto and Euro Youth Mental Health, the only European-wide organisation dedicated to improving the mental health support of young people, teamed up to create a safe space to have an honest conversation about how ""the best time of your life"" can be hard too.</p>
<p>Join us in this informal roundtable online where a former Erasmus student, a European Solidarity Corps volunteer, and a young professional in different countries will briefly share their joys and struggles, and best advice. Then, you will have the chance to listen and share experiences, fears, expectations, motivations, and your own tips with others in smaller groups facilitated by volunteers of Euro Youth Mental Health. Finally, a professional will give you some information and resources to look after your well-being while abroad and make the best of your current and future experiences.</p>
<p>More than ever, it is time to deconstruct stereotypes and create a debate about the (in)perfection surrounding Erasmus and living abroad. &nbsp;Guess what? It’s okay not to be okay, and it is okay to ask for help!</p>
<p>You are welcome to join us if you are a young person from any country who is currently living abroad; has lived in a different country; is considering/planning an international experience in the future. All you have to do is sign-up <a href=""https://forms.gle/suaJH7kNBBe89adP8""><u>HERE</u></a> to secure your spot. You will receive an email confirming your registration.<br>

<p><br></p>
<p>Hello brave travellers!</p>
<p>By now, you may think that you have seen the best that Portugal has to offer. You couldn’t be more far from the truth! Believe in us, you may have already visited some places, but we are sure you haven’t gone deep enough, for there are still hidden gems, hidden places of exceptional beauty, waiting for you to unearth them.</p>
<p>As the starting point of this awesome trip, we would like to take you to <strong>Tomar</strong>, considered a World Heritage by UNESCO. There, the imposing <strong>Convent of Christ</strong> stands, former stronghold of one of the most powerful orders of knights in Christendom, the Knights Templar! For those into old history, we have a special treat prepared for you, as you explore this ancient place of might and valor.</p>
<p>After the visit to the convent, we are taking you into the depths of the earth, where no sunlight penetrates: the <strong>caves of Mira de Aire</strong>. This cave system is the biggest in Portugal, reaching 600 meters in depth. Hope you are feeling adventurous.</p>
<p>After getting an insane amount of nice pictures for your Instagram, we will end our trip with a visit to <strong>Fátima</strong>, a city that is known for its religious symbolism. There you will get the chance to see one of the most magnificent and awe-inspiring shrines in Christendom, blessed by none other than Pope John Paul II. It is told that in 1916, the blessed Virgin Mary chose to appear before three children! The shrine was later built as a tribute to our lady.</p>

<p>Coimbra is located in the Center of Portugal and it’s one of the most ancient cities of the country, where the oldest university of Portugal and one of the oldest in Europe is situated - Universidade de Coimbra, founded 728 years ago. It is said that Luís Vaz de Camões, Portugal’s great national poet, studied at the University of Coimbra, nonetheless it was never proved. Coimbra is also characterized by its Fado (Fado de Coimbra) that was adopted by students at the University of Coimbra and it is usually considered the typical music of Coimbra itself.</p>

618e4fddae2fd63b0cefe4ee,Trip to S. Martinho Penafiel,2021-11-20 14:00:00.000,,"<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>It’s Autumn time and that means it's time for Magusto!!</p>
<p>Every year, this time of the year, Portuguese people come together to eat castanhas assadas (roasted chestnuts) and drink the new wine of this year’s harvest.</p>
<p>And this is what this trip is all about! Let’s celebrate this time of the year, travelling to one of the most famous Magusto in Portugal, the celebration of S. Martinho, in Penafiel.</p>
<p>S. Martinho is a celebration in honour of Saint Martin that became a Saint for a notable act, when he had cut his cloak in half to share with a beggar during a snowstorm, to save him from the cold. The legend said that the snowstorm stopped and the sun rose. That’s why in November, when it’s sunny, we call it Verão de S. Martinho (Saint Martin summer).</p>
<p>Join us in one of the most famous Portuguese tradicional holidays and discover good food, wine and also have fun with the people, music and carnival rides.</p>
<p>We will first stop at the closest preserved village near Porto, the Aldeia de Quintandona. Made entirely of schist, you will discover the wonders of a Portuguese little village.</p>
<p>Check the program out:</p>
<p>14h00 - Meeting Point in Reitoria</p>
<p>15h00 - Visit to Aldeia de Quintandona</p>
<p>16h00 - Visit to S. Martinho, in Penafiel</p>

<p>Scientists estimate there are 1 billion trillion stars in the observable universe AKA 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 stars (yes! this number is correct).

<p>Say, do you usually consider museums boring? Do you want to know more about culture – both Portuguese and from all the different wonderful regions and countries around the globe – but tend to feel that standing in a room full of paintings just doesn’t inspire you? Well, don’t worry, bestie, ‘cause ESN Porto has got you covered!</p>
<p>Join us on 7th November in visiting the talented, brilliant, show-stopping, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference <em>Museu e Parque de Serralves</em> (and did you get that reference?)! We’ll be exploring both Serralves’ museum and park on a guided tour, and ESN Porto might just have a nice little surprise for you at the end!</p>
<p>If you think that culture can’t be awesome, we’re about to prove you wrong! Not only will you be learning on this Sunday, but we promise you will have a ton of fun while you’re at it – and we’re not teachers nor museum curators, so we know what we’re talking about when mentioning fun!</p>

<p>We bet that, by now, you have already heard about our famous <em>Tascas</em>&nbsp;and if you haven’t, then get ready to uncover one of the best secrets Portugal has to offer!&nbsp;<br>
""What are «Tascas»?"", you may ask…Basically, they are very traditional and familial restaurants around the city that serve cheap, tasty, and typical food and drinks. They are those little places around you that you probably didn't even notice! And since you probably never actually got to try them out, we want to give you the best&nbsp;<em>Tascas</em>&nbsp;experience!<br>
<br>
<br>
They are where the best and most typical food can be tasted and where you can find any typical Portuguese eating a delicious <em>cachorrinho</em> or enjoying a glass of wine with a codfish cake we call <em>bolinho de bacalhau</em>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you think you were born too late to explore the world and too early to explore the universe, this&nbsp;Tascas&nbsp;Route will change your mind because, we assure you, you were born at the right time to explore our delicious typical food! In true Portuguese fashion, come and join us in this amazing food experience and talk, eat, drink and have fun because, as we bet you know, the best stories all start with some delicious food and a glass of beer in front of you!</p>

61680607ae2fd63b0cefcb15,Trip to Sintra ,2021-10-23 06:30:00.000,,"<p>Once upon a time, princes and princesses found a beautiful land to conquer. It was the charming village of Sintra, and this is the next destination we are bringing you to: In this trip we give you the opportunity to spend some time in a palace like the ones you only see at movies, fall in love in the most romantic gardens you’ll ever see and run out of breath with natural landscape, and as we couldn’t miss, we will also meet the ocean (of course, we are in Portugal) in Cabo da Roca which is known as the place “Where the land ends and the sea begins.” Sounds good, doesn’t it? But we still have more… We are going to walk along the wonderful beaches of our coast and give you a little taste of our capital city: Lisbon!</p>
<p>You’ll get the chance to visit one of the 7 wonders of Portugal, <strong>Palácio da Pena,</strong> and <strong>Quinta da Regaleira</strong>, a property classified as world heritage by UNESCO and known for the beautiful garden and the amazing architecture of the 20th century. Between rocks and hills, you’ll find <strong>Castelo dos Mouros </strong>that has a stunning view of Sintra and finally, come see the <strong>Boca do Inferno </strong>which is an unique sea-arch and cliff formation close to the town of Cascais with violent winter storms where&nbsp; water explodes upwards similar to an erupting volcano – hence the overdramatic name.</p>

<p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>Are you ready to go on a 3 days adventure?</p>
<p>This time, we are taking you to the capital, one of the world's greatest historical cities! Lisbon’s amazing sights, original street art and delicious traditional food are waiting for you!</p>
<p>You’ll have the opportunity to visit some of the most iconic monuments and get lost in the city’s picturesque narrow streets during the day! After that, we will have as much fun as COVID-19 let us!!!</p>
<p>During these 3 days, we are going to visit some places that will take your breath away, like Terreiro do Paço, which is one of the most majestic squares in Lisbon. It was once a palace but got almost completely destroyed after the 1755 earthquake. Castelo de São Jorge, an emblematic landmark where you will have an amazing view of the city, Rio Tejo and the Atlantic Ocean. You will also spot other fantastic places like Rossio square, Restauradores square, Rua Augusta and its arch, Pink Street, etc.</p>
<p>We couldn’t leave without passing by Jerónimos Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a 16th-century symbol of the wealth of the Age of Discovery, followed by Belém, which is the home of the Belém Tower, another World Heritage site, and probably the most important monument in Lisbon. It’s a 16th-century fortress where you can climb the spiral staircase up to the terrace, only to find a breathtaking panorama of the river.</p>
<p>And of course, you couldn’t go home without trying the traditional PASTEL DE BELÉM - the best in the country! At the end of the journey, we’ll visit the National Pantheon, the house of the tombs of Portugal’s major historic celebrities.</p>

<p>Right now you must be enjoying your first days in this beautiful city so we want to give you even more to experience! ESN Porto is taking you in a “rabelo” boat trip and also to Port wine tasting!! First we will start with a nice and relaxing boat trip in the Douro river, where you will be able to see the beautiful Unesco World Heritage Sites that you have on both sides of the river. After that we will visit a wine cellar where you’ll learn about Porto wine, which we are sure you all are eager to taste, how it’s produced and what is the main difference from regular wines. At the end, the moment you were waiting for, you can taste it!</p>
<p>Are you ready to join us as we share with you a part of our culture? Limited spots available.</p>

626ad035db70750d670fbfcf,[CANCELLED] Trip to Coimbra,2022-05-21 07:00:00.000,,"<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Do you like history? Do you love partying and students’ academic traditions?&nbsp; If so, this trip is going to be all you have been waiting for this semester, and more!</p>
<p>This amazing trip will start with Ruínas de Conimbriga, one of the oldest, biggest and most important archeology traces in Portugal. It used to be a city during the Roman Empire. Let’s dig into some ruins and resurrect B.C. memories.</p>
<p>About Paço das Escolas, we are talking about UNESCO World Heritage. It was the Royal Square since D. Afonso Henriques Kingdom, first king of Portugal in 1140 (oof that’s a lot of years ago). The Biblioteca &nbsp;Joanina is located at Paço das Escolas and it is a Baroque style Library, known as one of the biggest and most original European Baroque librabries!</p>
<p>Now the big mysterious part… Cortejo de Coimbra! We don’t want to give you spoilers, but let’s just say when Coimbra students go for it, they go for it all the way! Basically floats full of beer won’t be a thing missing. This Parade (Cortejo), marks the goodbyes for the seniors leaving college, and for the freshmen, it is about the integration on the academic life. It is a fun and unique experience, and a great way for you to understand how we really value and feel towards the academic life and traditions (yeah we are kinda extra regarding this, we already know).</p>
